Okay first you want to create a TextMeshPro object. Its under UI.
In Canvas (component), set render mode to "Screen Space - Camera". (idk why we have to do this, it was in the video I saw. Could be game breaking lol)
  After you select that option you can drag the main camera into the "Render Camera"
To change the font to Halloween. Go from my assets->TextMeshPro->Resources->Fonts&Materials and drag that into TextMeshPro's component Main Settings->Font Asset
You might have to zoom waaaay out to see where the text spawns at first. Width and Height determine how far the text can spread.
  I kept mine at a width of 250, height of 10, and font 60.

Create an empty object. Name is ScoreTracker.
Add the CandyScore script to this. This object will keep track of the score.
Drag the TextMeshPro object into the script component of ScoreTracker labeled "Text"

For each candy:
-Add box collider 2D component 
  Checkmark "Is Trigger"
-Add the candy script.
  Custom the candy value to whatever you want but keep it consistent!
Remember you can ctrl click the objects to highlight multiple at once. Then when adding one component to an object it'll update it for all selected objects.

  -Candy (I don't know if I still have this used but just label it anyways in case)
  -Player (should already be there)
